/*!
 Provides a mechanism for storing thread-specific data in a way that's designed
 to avoid key naming clashes.
 
 Under the hood, values are stored using the `threadDictionary` of the calling
 `NSThread`.

 ### Avoiding key clashes

 To prevent clashes between different code using thread-local storage, values
 are accessed by specifying the requesting `Class`.
 
 Classes that wish to store multiple values can also provide a unique key
 string for each value.
 
 ### Lock-free caching

 The `MBThreadLocalStorage` class also provides methods that allow treating
 thread-local storage as a lock-free cache. Objects that are expensive to 
 create, such as `NSDateFormatter` instances, can be cached in thread-local 
 storage without incurring the locking overhead that would be required by an
 object cache shared among multiple threads.

 Of course, the flipside to this is that a new cached object instance will be
 created for each individual `NSThread` that attempts to access the value.

 This mechanism is best suited for cases where the long-term expense of
 acquiring read locks every time the object is accessed is greater than the
 expense of creating a new instance multiplied by the number of unique threads 
 that will access the value.

 For example, an ideal use-case would be for caching values that are only
 accessed from the main thread.

 @note      As the class name implies, values set using `MBThreadLocalStorage`
            are only visible to the thread that set those values.
